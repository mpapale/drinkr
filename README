1. Get Mongodb.
2. Run Mongodb:
    mongod --dbpath path/to/something
3. Edit mongod connection string in server.js
4. Run npm install
5. cd to app/static and run bower install. (ensure you have already run npm install -d bower)
6. Run server:
    node server.js

** requires $GOOGLE_API_KEY env var to be set

Notes:
Your server.js is getting a bit crufty: consider using backbone-relational, as well as 
pushing the geocoding logic to the REST endpoint
